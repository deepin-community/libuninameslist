    * Version 1.9, Unicode 14.0. French version 1.4 is at Unicode 13.1.
      Unicode has changed cadence to release later for this year. This
      contains Official 14.0 NamesList.txt codes released on 2021sep14.

    * Unicode 14.0_Beta (Nameslist.txt 14_Beta for review until Jul08).
    * PR#24 "Remove .libs from linker paths". Bug found using slibtool.

    * Version 1.7, Unicode 13.0. French version 1.3 is at Unicode 13.0,
      and including python library wrapper 'uninameslist', version 0.2.
      The French version was updated from version 10.0 to 13.0 shortly
      after Unicode's release - this is a big effort and congratulation
      to the French team! This version updates the main library to also
      include access to libuninameslist-fr. To include this access, you
      need to use './configure --enable-frenchlib'
      This is the first step in adding other languages if anyone wants
      to add more languages.
      The default functions remain as English to retain common grounds
      which is necessary for scripting, and/or file-sharing purposes.

    * Version 1.3, Unicode 11.0. French version 1.2 is at Unicode 10.0.

      library to be loaded at a time. Base library maintains same names
      for backwards compatibility with older programs.

    * Add function calls to French version to allow use of one or more

    * Corrected library to report correctly as next version up. This is
      probably a significant change, therefore bumped both libraries to
      start at 1.0 even though backwards compatibility remains the same,
      otherwise would have become version_0.6 (and French version_0.4).
    * Removed the excessively long package name, which you'll note as a
      so-bump change with Fedora and also Debian in naming this package.

    * Removed several files that can be built during autoreconf and automake
      steps to building a tar.gz package.
    * Added additional check for -enable-oldfrenchlib to "make distcheck"
    * This will be tagged as version 0.3
